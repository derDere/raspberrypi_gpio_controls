# raspberrypi_gpio_controls
This python3 software is meant to me an easy way to work with the GPIOs on an Raspberry Pi. The software will display all GPIOs showing their layout and state. You can easely move between them using your arrow keys and toggle their staty with the space bar. The software is written using the unicurses library and can be run via terminal only. The software also requires the unicurses uniguard library whitch can be install from this repository: https://github.com/derDere/unicguard
