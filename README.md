# raspberrypi_gpio_controls

This python3 software is meant to me an easy way to work with the GPIOs on an Raspberry Pi.
The software will display all GPIOs showing their layout and state.
You can easely move between them using your arrow keys and toggle their state with the space bar.
The software is written in python3 using the unicurses library and can be run just with
the terminal or via an ssh connection.
The software also requires the unicurses unicguard library whitch can be
